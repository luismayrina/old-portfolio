Old Portfolio Website (First-Year Student Project)

ðŸš€ A simple portfolio website I developed during my first year for a school activity. This project showcases my early web development skills and includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for styling and layout.

âš  Note: The website is not mobile-friendly and is best viewed on desktop.

Features:
âœ” Personal introduction and portfolio section
âœ” Contact form (display-only, no backend functionality)
âœ” Newsletter sign-up (display-only, no backend functionality)
âœ” Basic layout using Bootstrap (but not fully responsive)
âœ” Static pages with simple styling
âœ” Basic form structure using HTML & CSS

Why I Built This:
This project was an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of web development, experiment with UI design, and apply Bootstrap for layout structuring, even though full responsiveness was not implemented.

Future Improvements:
ðŸ”¹ Implement full mobile responsiveness
ðŸ”¹ Improve UI/UX design
ðŸ”¹ Backend integration for form submissions
ðŸ”¹ Modernized code with frameworks
